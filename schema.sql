-- The SELECT statement is more specific this time. Instead of an asterisk to indicate that we want all of the records, we're requesting only the first and last names of the employees.
--FROM employees tells SQL in which of the six tables to look.
--The WHERE clause brings up even more specifics. We want SQL to look in the birth_date column for anyone born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.
--Notice how BETWEEN and AND are both capitalized in our statement? This is part of the SQL syntax. It not only signals the conditions present, but also makes the code easier to read.

-- Joining departments and dept_manager tables
-- The SELECT statement selects only the columns we want to view from each table.
-- The FROM statement points to the first table to be joined, Departments (Table 1).
-- INNER JOIN points to the second table to be joined, dept_manager (Table 2).
-- ON departments.dept_no = managers.dept_no; indicates where Postgres should look for matches.

ORDER BY does exactly as it reads: It puts the data output in order for us. Let's update our code. In the query editor, add the ORDER BY line to the end of the code block, so your code looks like the following:

-- Employee count by department number
SELECT COUNT(ce.emp_no), de.dept_no
INTO de_dept_no
FROM current_emp as ce
LEFT JOIN dept_emp as de
ON ce.emp_no = de.emp_no

ORDER BY de.dept_no;
